# FinSplit

A personal finance app I built to actually use. Tracks spending, budgets, investments, and splits bills with friends — all in one place.

## What it does

- **Transactions** — log income/expenses, filter, search, export CSV
- **Budgets** — set monthly limits per category, see what's left
- **Fixed payments** — rent, subscriptions, recurring stuff
- **Investments** — track holdings, gain/loss, portfolio allocation
- **Savings goals** — set targets, fund them over time
- **Bill splitting** — create groups, add expenses, see who owes who
- **Trip planner** — budget trips with multi-currency support
- **Receipt scanning** — paste receipt text, auto-parse into transactions
- **SMS import** — parse UzCard/Humo bank SMS into transactions
- **Telegram bot** — log expenses from chat
